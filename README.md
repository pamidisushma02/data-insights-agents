# 🤖 Data Insights Agents

A collection of intelligent **AI-powered agents** built to automate and enhance real-world workflows — from chat and search to HR automation and stock analysis.  
Each agent leverages cutting-edge frameworks such as **LangChain**, **Crew AI**, **Phidata**, and **Gemini** models.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository showcases a suite of **AI-powered agents** designed to automate diverse workflows — from web search and stock analysis to HR automation and resume screening.  

Each agent leverages a combination of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent orchestration frameworks**, and **modern embeddings** to demonstrate how intelligent systems can process information, reason, and generate insights autonomously.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore how **multi-agent collaboration** can improve reasoning and data-driven decisions.  
- Build modular, reusable frameworks for **AI applications in business and analytics**.  
- Demonstrate how different AI ecosystems — like **Gemini**, **Claude**, **GPT**, **Crew AI**, **LangChain**, and **Phidata** — can be integrated for end-to-end intelligent automation.
